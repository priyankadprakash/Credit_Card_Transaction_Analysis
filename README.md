# Credit_card_transaction_analysis
This repository contains an analysis of 25,000+ credit card transactions from 2013-2015, spanning nearly two years. It explores card types, expense categories, and spending patterns across 986 cities in India. Advanced SQL techniques reveal insights such as top spending cities, gender-based spending, and weekend purchasing behavior.

I began my journey by uncovering the diversity of transactions within the dataset, identifying four distinct card types: Silver, Signature, Gold, and Platinum. Each type represents different spending behaviors and user profiles, allowing me to segment my analysis effectively.

Next, I classified spending into six major expense categories: Entertainment, Food, Bills, Fuel, Travel, and Grocery. This classification illuminated consumer priorities, showcasing how individuals allocate their financial resources across different aspects of life.

One of the most exciting aspects of my analysis was the geographical breadth of the data, encompassing transactions from 986 unique cities across India. This extensive coverage enabled me to analyze spending behaviors not just regionally but on a national scale, highlighting trends and patterns that emerge across various demographics.

As I delved deeper, I employed advanced analytical techniques to uncover meaningful insights. My investigations led me to identify the top five cities contributing the most to credit card spending, along with patterns in monthly expenditures by card type. I also explored gender-based spending, which revealed significant contributions from female consumers across all expense categories.

Additionally, I examined weekend spending behavior, uncovering cities where users tend to make higher-value purchases, and identified the fastest-growing cities in terms of transaction volume, emphasizing the rapid adoption of credit cards in specific regions.

Ultimately, this analysis is not just a reflection of credit card usage across Indian cities but also a testament to the power of data analysis in uncovering deeper consumer insights. I invite you to explore my findings and the questions I tackled throughout this analytical journey
